# About Kultura

An application that is thoughtfully designed to assist users in classifying Indonesian cultural elements, such as batik, traditional food, and houses, goes beyond its informative purpose by actively contributing to the advancement of local businesses (UMKM). By providing detailed explanations about these cultural aspects, the application equips local businesses with a valuable resource to effectively showcase their products and services in an authentic and culturally relevant manner, thereby enhancing their competitiveness in the market.
